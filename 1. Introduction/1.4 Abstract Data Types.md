## 1.4 Abstract Data Types (ADTs)

To simplify the process of solving problems, we combine the data structures with their operations and we call this **Abstract Data Types** (ADTs).
An ADT consists of two parts:
1. Declaration of data
2. Declaration of operations

For example, **Stack** uses LIFO (Last In, First Out) organism while storing the data in data structures.
Common operations of it are: creating the stack, pushing an element onto the stack, popping an element from the stack, finding the current top of the stack, finding the number of elements in the stack, etc.
