## Algorithms

### 1.5 What is an Algorithm?

An algorithm is the step-by-step unambigous instructions to solve a given problem.

There are 2 main criterias for judging the merits of algorithms:
- Correctness (does the algorithm give the solution to the problem in a finite number of steps?)
- Efficiency (how much recourses - in terms of memory and time - does it take to execute)

### 1.6 Why the Analysis of Algorithm?

Algorithm analysis helps us to determine which algorithm is most efficient in terms of time and space consumed.

### 1.7 Goal of the Analysis of Algorithm

The goal of the analysis of algorithm is to compare algorithms (or solutions) mainly in terms of running time but also in terms of other factors (e.g., memory, developer effort, etc.)
