## Data Structures

Once we have data in variables, we need some mechanism for manipulating that data to solve problems.
**Data structure** is a particular way of storing and organizing data in a computer so that it can be used efficiently.
General data stucture types include arrays, files, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs and so on.

Depending on the organization of the elements, data structures are classified into two types:
1. **Linear data structures**: Elements are accessed in a sequential order but it is not compulsory to store all elements sequentially. Examples: Linked Lists, Stacks, and Queues.
2. **Non - linear data structures**: Elements of this data structure are stored/accessed in a non-linear order. Examples: Trees, and Graphs.
